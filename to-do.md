# products
- static raster for GIS people: exclude `s(year)`, `s(doy)`, and `ti(year,doy)`
- shiny app for predicting from the model given the data
- gif of mean and var over the years and over doy
- integrate shiny app into MoveBank? (use MoveApps?)

# figures for paper
- simulated data for mean and var with different smoothness
- plot grid of mean over space, `s(year)`, `s(doy)`, `s(elev)`
- plot grid of DENVar over space, `s(year)`, `s(doy)`, `s(elev)`, `s(mean)`
- histograms of DENVar around flat map of biomes (change colors)
- hex plots of DENVAr with other variables (add temperature, annual precip, extreme weather events, fires, invasive species, max body size, disease occurrence, ...)

supplementary:
- hex plots of pred vs obs for mean and var
- histograms of mean around flat map of biomes (change colors)
