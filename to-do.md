- could add distance to edge of polygon (after fusing polygons together at the island level)?
- subtract pixel-level mean residual before calculating the variance
- add pixel-level mean residual to the mean?
- find n of data points necessary for a stable estimate of variance for a given pixel: plot(var(resid) ~ n)
