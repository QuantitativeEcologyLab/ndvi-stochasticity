- make sure to only include cells fully inside polygons with `mask(..., touches = FALSE)`
- drop islands with no data
- make dfs for each year, then check total nrow and compare to max df size (2^31-1)
- average every ~9 (?) raster layers, maybe split by continents if too big
- start with oceania to check:
  - behavior of islands,
  - fitting time, and
  - diagnostics
  - (there's movement data for australia)
- expand to other regions or the whole world
