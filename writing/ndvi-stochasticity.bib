	abstract = {Species responses to climate change may be influenced by changes in available habitat, as well as population processes, species interactions and interactions between demographic and landscape dynamics. Current methods for assessing these responses fail to provide an integrated view of these influences because they deal with habitat change or population dynamics, but rarely both. In this study, we linked a time series of habitat suitability models with spatially explicit stochastic population models to explore factors that influence the viability of plant species populations under stable and changing climate scenarios in South African fynbos, a global biodiversity hot spot. Results indicate that complex interactions between life history, disturbance regime and distribution pattern mediate species extinction risks under climate change. Our novel mechanistic approach allows more complete and direct appraisal of future biotic responses than do static bioclimatic habitat modelling approaches, and will ultimately support development of more effective conservation strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses due to climate change.},

Up to now, the process of creating the {HFI} has required significant data and modeling, and updated versions of the index often lag the present day by many years. Here we introduce a near-present, global-scale machine learning-based {HFI} (ml-{HFI}) which is capable of routine update using satellite imagery alone. We present the most up-to-date map of the {HFI}, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000–2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 ({SDG}15), ‘Life on Land’, which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify 43 countries that are making progress toward {SDG}15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-{HFI}. We examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward {SDG}15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030. Moving forward, the ml-{HFI} may be used for ongoing monitoring and evaluation support toward the twin goals of fostering a thriving society and global Earth system.},

To index such high-quality forage, recent work proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up ({IRG}), i.e. rate of change in the normalized difference vegetation index over time. Despite this important advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak {IRG}. We evaluated this assumption using step selection functions parametrized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and bison, totalling 463 individuals monitored 1–3 years from 2004 to 2014. Accounting for variables that typically influence habitat selection for each species, we found seven of 10 populations selected patches exhibiting high {IRG}—supporting the {GWH}. Nonetheless, large herbivores selected for the leading edge, trailing edge and crest of the {IRG} wave, indicating that other mechanisms (e.g. ruminant physiology) or measurement error inherent with satellite data affect selection for {IRG}. Our evaluation indicates that {IRG} is a useful tool for linking herbivore movement with plant phenology, paving the way for significant advancements in understanding how animals track resource quality that varies both spatially and temporally.},

            The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}), one of the earliest remote sensing analytical products used to simplify the complexities of multi-spectral imagery, is now the most popular index used for vegetation assessment. This popularity and widespread use relate to how an {NDVI} can be calculated with any multispectral sensor with a visible and a near-{IR} band. Increasingly low costs and weights of multispectral sensors mean they can be mounted on satellite, aerial, and increasingly—Unmanned Aerial Systems ({UAS}). While studies have found that the {NDVI} is effective for expressing vegetation status and quantified vegetation attributes, its widespread use and popularity, especially in {UAS} applications, carry inherent risks of misuse with end users who received little to no remote sensing education. This article summarizes the progress of {NDVI} acquisition, highlights the areas of {NDVI} application, and addresses the critical problems and considerations in using {NDVI}. Detailed discussion mainly covers three aspects: atmospheric effect, saturation phenomenon, and sensor factors. The use of {NDVI} can be highly effective as long as its limitations and capabilities are understood. This consideration is particularly important to the {UAS} user community.},

            Tracking seasonally changing resources is regarded as a widespread proximate mechanism underpinning animal migration. Migrating herbivores, for example, are hypothesized to track seasonal foliage dynamics over large spatial scales. Previous investigations of this green wave hypothesis involved few species and limited geographical extent, and used conventional correlation that cannot disentangle alternative correlated effects. Here, we introduce stochastic simulations to test this hypothesis using 222 individual spring migration episodes of 14 populations of ten species of geese, swans and dabbling ducks throughout Europe, East Asia, and North America. We find that the green wave cannot be considered a ubiquitous driver of herbivorous waterfowl spring migration, as it explains observed migration patterns of only a few grazing populations in specific regions. We suggest that ecological barriers and particularly human disturbance likely constrain the capacity of herbivorous waterfowl to track the green wave in some regions, highlighting key challenges in conserving migratory birds.},

While several analytical approaches have emerged to determine biologically relevant spatial scales – the spatial scale that most strongly influences the ecological patterns observed – identifying key ecological drivers of scale of effect is still underway. Additionally, several predicted ecological drivers of scale of effect can vary across space and time, but little research on spatiotemporal patterns has occurred. Here, I assessed spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect across 32 North American bird species using 18 years of empirical data from the North American breeding bird survey. Scale estimation was then coupled with trait‐based analyses and hypotheses testing of underlying processes of spatial and temporal variation in scales of effect. All 32 species tested exhibited varied scales of effect across years (average annual scales of effect ranging from 0.2 to 4.97 km) and Bird Conservation Regions ({BCR}), with spatial variability being the most pronounced. Trait‐based analyses revealed a contrary relationship between hand‐wing index, body size, and scale of effect, though the strength of this relationship was contingent on migratory status. Temporal variation in scales of effect was best explained by changes in human development over time, indicating that avian space use can be explained by an increasing human footprint. Additionally, relative population size, consistent with theoretical predictions stemming from density‐dependent population dynamics, explained notable variation in spatial and temporal scales of effect. These findings contribute to the growing landscape ecology literature by providing empirical evidence for hypothesized drivers of scales of effect. By delineating species‐specific scales of effect and elucidating their ecological drivers, this study enhances our understanding of spatial and temporal scales in ecological processes, aiding conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.},

              Migratory ungulates are thought to be declining globally because their dependence on large landscapes renders them highly vulnerable to environmental change. Yet recent studies reveal that many ungulate species can adjust their migration propensity in response to changing environmental conditions to potentially improve population persistence. In addition to the question of
              whether
              to migrate, decisions of
              where
              and
              when
              to migrate appear equally fundamental to individual migration tactics, but these three dimensions of plasticity have rarely been explored together. Here, we expand the concept of migratory plasticity beyond individual switches in migration propensity to also include spatial and temporal adjustments to migration patterns. We develop a novel typological framework that delineates every potential change type within the three dimensions, then use this framework to guide a literature review. We discuss broad patterns in migratory plasticity, potential drivers of migration change, and research gaps in the current understanding of this trait. Our result reveals 127 migration change events in direct response to natural and human‐induced environmental changes across 27 ungulate species. Species that appeared in multiple studies showed multiple types of change, with some exhibiting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity. This result highlights that multidimensional migratory plasticity is pervasive in ungulates, even as the manifestation of plasticity varies case by case. However, studies thus far have rarely been able to determine the fitness outcomes of different types of migration change, likely due to the scarcity of long‐term individual‐based demographic monitoring as well as measurements encompassing a full behavioral continuum and environmental gradient for any given species. Recognizing and documenting the full spectrum of migratory plasticity marks the first step for the field of migration ecology to employ quantitative methods, such as reaction norms, to predict migration change along environmental gradients. Closer monitoring for changes in migratory propensity, routes, and timing may improve the efficacy of conservation strategies and management actions in a rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              From megafauna to amoebas, the amount of space heterotrophic organisms use is thought to be tightly linked to the availability of resources within their habitats, such that organisms living in productive habitats generally require less space than those in resource-poor habitats. This hypothesis has widespread empirical support, but existing studies have focused primarily on responses to spatiotemporal changes in mean resources, while responses to unpredictable changes in resources (i.e., variance in resources or resource stochasticity) are still largely unknown. Since organisms adjust to variable environmental conditions, failing to consider the effects of resource unpredictability can result in an insufficient understanding of an organism’s range size.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We leverage the available literature to provide a unifying framework and hypothesis for the effects of resource abundance and stochasticity on organisms’ range sizes. We then use simulated movement data to demonstrate how the combined effects of resource abundance and stochasticity interact to shape predictable patterns in range size. Finally, we test the hypothesis using real-world tracking data on a lowland tapir (
                Tapirus terrestris
                ) from the Brazilian Cerrado.
              
            
            
              Results
              Organisms’ range sizes decrease nonlinearly with resource abundance and increase nonlinearly with resource stochasticity, and the effects of resource stochasticity depend strongly on resource abundance. Additionally, the distribution and predictability of resources can exacerbate the effects of other drivers of movement, such as resource depletion, competition, and predation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Accounting for resource abundance and stochasticity is crucial for understanding the movement behavior of free-ranging organisms. Failing to account for resource stochasticity can lead to an incomplete and incorrect understanding of how and why organisms move, particularly during periods of rapid change.},
